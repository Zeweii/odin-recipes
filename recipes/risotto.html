        <h3>
            Risotto is a traditional Italian rice dish made from a short-grained, starchy variety of 
            rice called Arborio rice. A properly cooked risotto should form a soft, creamy mound on 
            a dinner plate—it shouldn't run across the plate, nor should it be stiff or gluey. 
            While not difficult, some essential tips will help you make restaurant-worthy risotto at home.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            
            <li>4 cups (1 quart) chicken stock</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>

            <li>1 medium shallot, chopped (about 1/2 cup; or 1/2 small onion, chopped)</li>

            <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>

            <li>1/2 cup dry vermouth (or dry white wine)</li>

            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped</li>

            <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>

            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>



            <li>¼ cup water</li>
        
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        
            <li>12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, or more if needed</li>
        
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        
            <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        
            <li>1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>
        
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer. Lower the heat so
                the stock stays hot while you cook the risotto.</li>

            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the 
                butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot or onion. 
                Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly translucent.</li>

            <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that the grains 
                are coated with the oil and melted butter. Sauté for another minute or so, until 
                there is a slightly nutty aroma. Make sure not to let the rice turn brown. </li>

            <li>Add the vermouth or wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed.</li>

            <li>Add a ladle of hot chicken stock to the rice and stir every once in a while until 
                the liquid is fully absorbed. When the rice appears almost dry, add another ladle of 
                stock and repeat the process. </li>

            <li>Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for about 20 minutes or until the grains are 
                tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy (al dente). </li>

            <li>Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmesan cheese and parsley. 
                Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>

            <li>Serve in bowls and enjoy.</li>
